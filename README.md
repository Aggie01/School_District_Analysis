# School_District_Analysis
## Background:
- Standardized math and reading scores for 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th graders for city school district were gathered.  
- Data scientist for the school district is asked to present the findings to the city school board. 
- Based on preliminary analysis, evidence of academic dishonesty is suspected, suggesting that the THS scores are significantly skewed.

## Purpose:
- **Prove** the evidence of academic dishonesty with the main focuse on Thomas High School (THS) or
- **Disprove** the evidence of such academic dishonesty 

## Main Goal:
- Establish conclusion if the THS school dishonesty evidence was properly collected

## Methodology:
- Refactoring the THS student count by replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores with NaN's while keeping the rest of data intact

## Expected Deliverables: 
- Overall district summary
- School summary (THS)
- Impact or lack of it of replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores at THS based on:
        - overall THS performance vs otehr schools
        - math & reading scores by grade
        - school spending
        - scores by school size
        - scores by school type

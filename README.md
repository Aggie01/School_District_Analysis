# School_District_Analysis
## Background:
- Standardized math and reading scores for **9th, 10th, 11th and 12th graders** for the city school district were gathered.  
- Data scientist for the school district was asked to present the findings to the city school board. 
- Based on preliminary analysis, evidence of the academic dishonesty was suspected, suggesting that the THS scores were significantly skewed.

## Purpose:
- **Prove** the evidence of academic dishonesty with the main focuse on Thomas High School (THS) or
- **Disprove** the evidence of such academic dishonesty 

## Main Goal:
- Establish conclusion wheather the evidence of suspected THS school dishonesty was properly collected

## Methodology:
- Refactoring the THS student count by replacing the 9th graders' math and reading scores with NaN's while keeping the rest of data intact

## Expected Deliverables: 
- Overall district summary
- School summary (THS)
- Impact or lack of it of replacing THS 9th graders' math and reading scores with NaNs:
  - overall THS performance vs other schools
  - math & reading scores by grade
  - school spending
  - scores by school size
  - scores by school type
        
## Results:
### Overall district summary
- Averages score for math: 78.9%

### Thomas High School summary including 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th graders
- Averages score for math: 83.4%
- Average score for reading: 83.8%
